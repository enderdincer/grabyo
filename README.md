Hand Rankings
A hand always consist of five cards. Individual cards are "ranked" as follows (high-to-low): A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. ACE can be low, but only when part of an A-2-3-4-5 straight. Suits (Club, Diamond, Heart, Spade) have no value, so if two players have hands that are identical except for suit, then they are tied. A "Kicker" card is a high card used to break ties between hands of the same rank (ex. 2 players with "Four of a Kind", 3 K's on the board. P1 has K, 9 and P2 has K, 6. P1 with K, 9 wins with the "9 Kicker".)

Here are the "Rank of Hands" in the order of Strength with Probability of being dealt.
